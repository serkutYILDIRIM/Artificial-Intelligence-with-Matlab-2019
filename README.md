# Artificial-Intelligence-with-Matlab-2019
I developed this projects when i was in the second semester of the 4th grade at school in 2019.
These projects helped me to improve my programming and analytical thinking skills.

Cok katmanlÄ± ysa Project:

     In this project, i simulated a multi-layer artificial neural network with Matlab.
     
REGRESYON COKLU YSA, YSAReg, regresyon ysa network and regresyon ysa Projects:

     In these projects, i studied on regression with artificial neural network.
      
cnn Project:

     I simulated a convolutional neural network with Matlab.

YapaySinirAgiSiniflandirma Project:

     In this project, i classified the data with artificial neural network.

implemention Project:

     In this project, i studied on images with Relu, Pooling and Softmax.

neural network Project:

     In this project, i trained an artificial neural network.

srgann Project:

     I developed a Srgann with Matlab.In this project, I studied on image zooming with Srgan.
     This Srgan zooms the image by passing it through the Convolution and Relu layers.

yapaySiniragi Project:

     In this project, i designed a back propagation artificial neural network.
